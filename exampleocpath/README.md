# OpenConfig ygot Example Go Path Structs

This directory contains an example generated set of path structs from a subset
of the OpenConfig models.

This package **WILL** change without warning, and **SHOULD NOT** be imported
into your application. Rather, you should generate bindings directly using the
ygot package.
