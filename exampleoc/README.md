# OpenConfig ygot Example Go Structs

This directory contains an example generated set of structs from a subset of the
OpenConfig models. They are used within demo applications in the
[ygot/demo](https://github.com/openconfig/ygot/tree/master/demo) directory.

This package **WILL** change without warning, and **SHOULD NOT** be imported
into your application. Rather, you should generate bindings directly using the
ygot package.
