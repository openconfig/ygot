/*
Package demo is a generated package which contains definitions
of structs which represent a YANG schema. The generated schema can be
compressed by a series of transformations (compression was false
in this case).

This package was generated by /Users/robjs/Code/go/src/github.com/openconfig/ygot/ygen/commongen.go
using the following YANG input files:
	- yang/example.yang
Imported modules were sourced from:
	- yang/...

// ΛEnumTypes is a map, keyed by a YANG schema path, of the enumerated types that
// correspond with the leaf. The type is represented as a reflect.Type. The naming
// of the map ensures that there are no clashes with valid YANG identifiers.
var ΛEnumTypes = map[string][]reflect.Type{}
