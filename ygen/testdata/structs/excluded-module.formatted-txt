/*
Package ocstructs is a generated package which contains definitions
of structs which represent a YANG schema. The generated schema can be
compressed by a series of transformations (compression was false
in this case).

This package was generated by codegen-tests
using the following YANG input files:
	- testdata/structs/excluded-module.yang
