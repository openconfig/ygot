/*
Package ocstructs is a generated package which contains definitions
of structs which represent a YANG schema. The generated schema can be
compressed by a series of transformations (compression was true
in this case).

This package was generated by codegen-tests
using the following YANG input files:
	- ../testdata/modules/openconfig-simple-target.yang
	- ../testdata/modules/openconfig-simple-augment.yang
Imported modules were sourced from:
