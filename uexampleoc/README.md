# OpenConfig Uncompressed ygot Example Go Structs

This directory contains an example generated set of structs from a subset of the
OpenConfig models. This particular build has an *uncompressed* output, and is
used for integration tests.

This package **WILL** change without warning, and **SHOULD NOT** be imported
into your application. Rather, you should generate bindings directly using the
ygot package.
